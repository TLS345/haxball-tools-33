# Day 33 - Coin Flip 

**By TLS / Teleese**

This repository contains a simple  script that implements a **virtual coin flip** command in your room.  

With the `!coin` command, any player can flip a coin and get either "heads" or "tails". Perfect for quick decisions or just for fun during a game.  

## Usage

1. Copy the `coin.js` file into your project.  
2. Run your bot and type `!coin` in the room chat.  
3. The bot will automatically respond with the coin toss result.
